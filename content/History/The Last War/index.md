# Beginnings
The Last War erupted with the death of King Jarot of [[content/Other Nations/Galifar/index|Galifar]] in 894 YK. This single event shattered the centuries long peace that Khorvaire had benefitted from, and the [[content/Five Nations/index|Five Nations]] descended into a century of conflict. 

Whilst the succession of [[content/Other Nations/Galifar/index|Galifar]] had been respected in times past, Jarot's children were unable to reconcile their claims. Jarot had chosen Princess Mishann of [[content/Five Nations/Cyre/index|Cyre]] to inherit the throne, however Prince Thalin of [[content/Five Nations/Thrane/index|Thrane]] vehemently disagreed and believed he was the best choice. With Mishann chosen by Jarot, Prince Wrogar of [[content/Five Nations/Aundair/index|Aundair]] gave a promise to stand by the chosen heir. Unfortunately for Mishann and Wrogar, Prince Kaius I of [[content/Five Nations/Karrnath/index|Karrnath]] and Princess Wroann of [[content/Five Nations/Breland/index|Breland]] opted to side with Thalin. 

By years end, the war had began.
