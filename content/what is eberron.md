Eberron is a world best described as being *pulp*. Within its confines are the tools required to run an adventure amidst darkened temples, rain-slicked alleyways, and lightning-rail heists. 
# Shellshock
In the year 998 YK, Eberron (particularly [[content/khorvaire|Khorvaire]]) is a world rocked by a one-hundred year conflict. That was The Last War, and it only came to a tenuous peace two years ago with the Treaty of Thronehold. A comparison in our own world would be a combination of the Hundred Years' War and the First World War. As such, this continent spanning civil war saw the end of the [[content/Other Nations/Galifar/index|Kingdom of Galifar]], and the independence of a number of new and pre-existing nations. 

However, the treaty has only called a pause to the conflict, and whilst hostilities may officially be over at this time, the war itself is seemingly inevitable. After all, the anger and pain brought on by such a long period of suffering has yet to be washed away by time. 

The loss of [[content/Five Nations/Cyre/index|Cyre]] has only given cause for concern, a wariness of weapons beyond anything they have witnessed. 

As such, even amongst the shadows, competition is afoot. 
# The Houses
Khorvaire's nations and their people are entangled in the machinations of the twelve Dragonmarked Houses. These houses are the lords and masters of industry, and almost all of them bear an unknown sigil known only as a Dragonmark. Neutral parties of the Last War, their political influence is boundless. 

They are, for all intents and purposes, proto-megacorporation's.

|                | The Mark of Shadow      |                    |
|                | The Mark of Storm       |                    |
|                | The Mark of Warding     |                    |
# Magic is Wide
Eberron is a world where low-level magic is as common as available as pennies. Science isn't dominant here, but Magic is treated in such a way. It is repeatable, something to be mastered, it can be easily taught and studied. 

Farmers can easily acquire enchanted tools to do the bulk of labour for them, allowing them to spend more time with family and loved ones. Whilst factory workers may have spanners capable of loosening even the most impossibly tight bolt. 

Perhaps most notably of all, is the creation of sentient beings known as Warforged, in the enormous creation forges of House Cannith. 

Whilst the common priests and scholars of Khorvaire may be unable to cast spells, and pale in comparison to the Clerics and Wizards of the world, they may yet bear powerful magic within their boots and gloves.
