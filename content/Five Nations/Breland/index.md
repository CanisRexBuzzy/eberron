The south-westerly of the [[content/Five Nations/index|Five Nations]], Breland has been a part of Khorvaire since Humans first established themselves on the continent, much to the displeasure of the Goblin Kingdoms. In days past, Breland's borders stretched across [[content/Other Nations/Droaam/index|Droaam]] and [[content/Other Nations/Zilargo/index|Zilargo]], whilst sharing land borders with Cyre, Thrane and Aundair lay to its east, north and north-west respectively. 

Presently, the independence of Zilargo and Breland has come out on top as one of the most influential and potent nations of Khorvaire. It boasts a large population of over three million, and prizes itself on an abundance of natural resources and the industry to successfully exploit it.

Breland is governed from its capital city, Wroat. It is one of the metropolei of the kingdom, alongside Sharn. 

# Culture & People

The Brelish people are known for a sense of rationality and free-spirit. While they may not be as beholden to a desire for knowledge as the people of Zilargo, they still maintain an ability to adjust and overcome challenges, often through a potent degree of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. As seen in their industrial ability, including the construction of the mobile fortresses Djarn, Argonth and their sisters. 

The Brelish people are also earmarked by a sense of cynicism and at times, nihilism. This makes the Brelish people not just capable of great feats of espionage, but also capable of great feats of crime. 

As such, Breland is a hotbed of spies and criminal enterprise.

>[!info] In My Eberron
> Here, and likely in other versions of Eberron, Breland is vastly inspired by Britain and other Anglo-Saxon nations such as the United States of America and Australia. I think this inspiration should be fairly self-evident. Sharn, the City of Towers, is a megacity evocative of London and New York City, whilst the vast and countryside is filled with forestry and farmlands. To the west, the border of Droaam is evocative of the Wild West. Whilst I personally view the eastern plains of Breland to be akin to the ranchlands of Australia, and facing dangerous creatures that lurk at the edges of the Mournlands. 

The Boromar Clan remains not only the eldest of the criminal organisations with Breland, but its most powerful. A network of Halflings, whose people have come eastwards from the Talenta Plains. They're rivalled however by House Tarkanan, whose Aberrant Dragonmarks confer a number of advantages. Not to mention the monsters of Daask, another criminal organisation which has its roots in Droaam.
