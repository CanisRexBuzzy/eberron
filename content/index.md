Hello, friends!

If you're seeing this, and you aren't one of my players, then I hope this site serves as a source of inspiration for your own worlds, whether that's Eberron or otherwise. 

If you're one of my players, I hope this if beneficial for keeping you up to par on Eberron lore, and the story of the world as it unfolds for us. 

> [!info] In My Eberron
> Please keep an eye out for the In My Eberron callouts, they'll help you to know which information has sprung from my own mind, or when I've made use of collective creations known as Fanon. Where possible, I'll reference individuals responsible for the creations.
>
> However, it's generally safe to assume that any details outside of these callouts has come from canonical sources such as the Eberron Campaign Setting, or has been patched over by Keith Baker's further works such as Exploring Eberron.

As such, this site will continue to grow and expand as these very player facing notes become more self-evident and available. If you find a benefit to them, please let me know!
