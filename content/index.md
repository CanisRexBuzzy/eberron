Hello, friends!

If you're seeing this, and you aren't one of my players, then I hope this site serves as a source of inspiration for your own worlds, whether that's Eberron or otherwise. 

If you're one of my players, I hope this if beneficial for keeping you up to par on Eberron lore, and the story of the world as it unfolds for us. 

> [!info] In My Eberron
> Please keep an eye out for the In My Eberron callouts, they'll help you to know which information has sprung from my own mind, or in collaboration with others. Where possible, these individuals will be referenced. I'll also use these boxes to remark on when it has come from Keith Baker, the mastermind behind Eberron.
